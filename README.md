# Morse-Code-Encoder-and-Decoder with Arduino.

This project uses 2 Arduino UNO boards, one acting as the transmitter which encodes the given data to morse code and sends corresponding laser signals, while other board receives the laser signal and detects them using an LDR (light dependent resistor) and decodes the signals to the original data which was sent to the transmitter.
I have used LED instead of a laser here due to it's inavailiability, but the model works perfectly fine with laser also, so you can choose either one of them according to your preference.

__IDE used:__ 
Arduino IDE

__Componenets used:__
1. Arduino UNO (x2)
2. LDR (x1)
3. Laser/LED (x1)
4. 330 ohm Resistor (x1)
5. 1k ohm Resistor (x1)
6. Wires (male to male wires) (x5)
7. Breadboard (x2)

You can also add a buzzer in serier to the laser/LED to make this project more fun.
