# Morse-Code-Encoder-and-Decoder-
Morse code encoder and decoder for Arduino based project.

In this project I have used 2 Arduino UNO boards, one acting as the transmitter which encodes the given data to morse code and sends corresponding laser signals, while other board receives the laser signal and detects them using an LDR (light dependent resistor) and decodes the signals to the original data which was sent to the transmitter.

Componenets used:
1. Arduino UNO (x2)
2. LDR (x1)
3. Laser/LED (x1)
4. 330 ohm Resistor (x1)
5. 1k ohm Resistor (x1)
6. Wires (male to male wires) (x5)
7. Breadboard (x2)
